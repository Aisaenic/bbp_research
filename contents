This is possibly a failed attempt. Several towns not covered, visiting during office hours when individuals aint available is another major factor.  Poor awareness campaign and lack of information about this is also why several people aint sharing any information.

@tbatde @angelalevin1 @SkyNewsAust Personally I agree but that wasn’t my point. The court case date had nothing to do with Charles &amp; Camillas (highly successful) state visit.
@jomilleweb King Charles has 75 years of Training in being King &amp; actually spent the last 3 years of Queen Elizabeth's Reign, standing in for her during State Opening of Parliament and Remenberance Sunday Ceremonies, because she was too frail. King has made very successful German State Visit
@silver_lining85 @duchess_salty This case was just an opportunity to usurp KCIII &amp; QC first State visit to France. Nobody could have forseen the postponement of same. Court date came in handy. I don't believe Harry would have come over for it if the State visits weren't scheduled for the same time.
Thank you for visiting "us": The state visit to France, I hope, will follow suit after His Majesty's Coronation. @CerstinGammelin @EmmanuelMacron @SZ
Just trying to clarify because I think many of you are confused.   A state visit is multiple days and consist of many events. The state dinner is it’s own event. Blackpink would perform at a different event. A date which we don’t know. That’s why it’s still potentially possible.

@RobertD40730641 @Spriter99880 I think they should give President Macroon and the French face as it is a state visit. VDL can travel in the bus with the rest of the delegation. You need to give face to a head of state.
@Spriter99880 Added to this the state visit by Macroon should be offered every vestige as such. Given a car with escort and the French anthem be played. VDL should be allowed in with the rest of the crew on the bus.

@KirstenIGower @MirrorRoyal You do realise that he turned up for a court hearing when he didn’t need to. He was looking for attention but it didn’t went as well as he expected. And you think that a state visit was planned yesterday? H knew King is not going to be in UK that’s why he came. It’s obvious.
@Marta3618 @MirrorRoyal Why do you call Harry Harold? I do realise it's the name of a king, but still. How could H try to overshadow his father when his court dates were set before the state visit? Seriously! I am not saying that KC3's visit wasn't a success but that the media is obsessed with his son.
@DawnSDTW That's a state visit, which US Presidents do. This is different. They're mad Biden won't attend the coronation. The last time a UK monarch was crowned was back in the 50s. The President didn't attend that.
@RoyallyBlunt I don't get why she wouldn't. POW wears a tiara for a state visit, but not to a coronation? If she doesn't it's because that's what the king/Queen decided. If no tiaras-hope the reason is not to apeace the spare and wife.

“By the end of 2001, Blair had met Putin nine times since he’d become Russia’s president less than two years before. Then, in June 2003, Putin was given the first British state visit for a Russian premier since 1874.”  Iraq War started in March 2003.  Iraq War referenced a lot.

WHY would @JoeBiden or any POTUS attend the coronation of a British Monarch? America had a fvcking war to get rid of a King, why would it’s president bow at a  coronation? State visit is one thing a Coronation is completely different.   🇨🇦 here &amp; as a FORMER Monarchist 🖕🏽Chuck!

@MEverettWilbert Exactly right. I’ve been looking as far back as I can into other countries’ coronations: Nepal, Tonga - delegations were sent. As for Inaugurations: correct. The only thing I “anticipate” of @POTUS is a possible State visit to @RoyalFamily.

@hr_haddow @GBNEWS Not true. Biden and QEII got along well. He had a lot of respect for her. Once Charles is officially king Biden will invite them for a state visit. No president has attended a coronation. Eisenhower skipped it in 1952. So did Truman and Monroe before that.

@GBNEWS No, it's not. UK monarchy hasn't attended POTUS inaugurations &amp; POTUS hasn't attended coronations. Why? Because we had a war that separated our political systems 247 years ago. Biden will invite KC3 to the WH for a state visit after the coronation when he's officially king.

@richardaeden No question: Trump would have attended. If for no other reason than it would keep Markle away. (lol)  Remember how Markle was "ill" for Trump's state visit in 2019 and then recovered the next day. That warned me that Markle has a political agenda - and still does.
@RoyallyBlunt He is in briefings with the King &amp; staff on state visit. King things 😎

@RoyalFamily Fantastic State visit…so refreshing to see such positivity! Germans showed how it’s done…very classy  #StateVisitGermany 🇩🇪🇬🇧👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
@THERoyalCrabbit I am probably the only one thinking this but I'm glad the French visit was cancelled - it would have been  messy with all their issues and the German one was brilliant - just a great first state visit
I will, in due course, probably tomorrow, launch a thorough thread on the State Visit of Their Majesties, King Charles III and Queen Camilla. By all accounts, a MASSIVE SUCCESS.
@richardaeden No. No American President would. But I know Trump respected the late Queen as he said so himself. He’ll do a state visit after KC’s coronation.
